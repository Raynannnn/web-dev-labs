  <!-- B. Our Story Section -->
  <section>
    <p>Bean &amp; Brew started as a tiny weekend pop‑up by friends who loved two things:
       coffee and community. We believe good coffee should be approachable, ethically
       sourced, and served with a smile. Every cup helps support small farmers, and
       every visit helps build a friendlier neighborhood.</p>
